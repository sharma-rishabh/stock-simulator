## **🛠️ Setup & Data Structures**

-  **Initialize Java Project**

-  **Create `Stock` class** with:

    - [ ]  `String symbol`, `double price`, `AtomicInteger volume`
    - [ ]  Store stocks in **ConcurrentHashMap** (`symbol -> stock price`)
-  **Create `User` class** with:

    - [ ]  `String name`, `ConcurrentMap<String, Integer> portfolio`
    - [ ]  Methods for **buying/selling stocks**
-  **Set up `BlockingQueue<Order>`** for pending trades


---

## **📈 Stock Price Updates**

- [ ]  **Create `StockPriceUpdater` thread**
    - [ ]  Runs in **ScheduledExecutorService**
    - [ ]  Updates prices every few seconds
    - [ ]  Uses **volatile** for visibility across threads
    - [ ]  Store updates in **ConcurrentHashMap**

---

## **📊 Order Processing System**

-  **Create `OrderProcessor` thread**

    - [ ]  Reads from **BlockingQueue**
    - [ ]  Uses **synchronized blocks** for transaction updates
    - [ ]  Uses **ReentrantLock** to prevent deadlocks
    - [ ]  Validates stock availability & user balance
-  **Implement Thread Safety Mechanisms**

    - [ ]  Use **Compare-And-Swap (CAS)** for atomic stock updates
    - [ ]  Use **ThreadLocal** for user session data
    - [ ]  Prevent **race conditions** when multiple users trade the same stock

---

## **🚀 Fork/Join for Market Analysis**

- [ ]  **Create `MarketAnalyzer` using Fork/Join Framework**
    - [ ]  Splits stock data into smaller chunks
    - [ ]  Computes total market capitalization in **parallel**
    - [ ]  Aggregates results efficiently

---

## **⚡ Performance Optimization & Error Handling**

-  **Deadlock Prevention**

    - [ ]  Implement **timeout-based locks**
    - [ ]  Use **lock ordering** to avoid circular dependencies
-  **Optimize Thread Execution**

    - [ ]  Use **dynamic thread pool scaling**
    - [ ]  Reduce false sharing to prevent cache contention
-  **Error Handling & Recovery**

    - [ ]  Implement transaction rollback on failures
    - [ ]  Retry mechanism for failed transactions
    - [ ]  Ensure logging tracks failed orders

---

## **📜 Logging & Monitoring**

- [ ]  **Log all stock updates & trades**
- [ ]  **Monitor performance metrics (latency, congestion, execution time)**
- [ ]  **Implement trade notification system for users**

---

## **✅ Final Testing & Deployment**

- [ ]  **Simulate multiple users trading concurrently**
- [ ]  **Stress test with high-volume transactions**
- [ ]  **Analyze system performance under load**
- [ ]  **Deploy the system & document the architecture**
